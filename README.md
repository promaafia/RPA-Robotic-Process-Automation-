## Why RPA?

1. **Scenario 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection System**
    1. Points which are checked:
        1. Last location of access
        2. Usual amount of transaction
        3. Number of times, wrong pin entered

## What is RPA?

> RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation
> 

<aside>

**Robotic :** An entity which is capable of being programmed by a computer for doing complex tasks is known as a robot. In terms of RPA, this tasks would be to **mimic the human actions.

Process: A sequence of steps**, that lead to a meaningful activity or tasks is known as a process.

**Automation:** When a task happens automatically, i.e. **without human intervention.**

## RPA Lifecycle

<aside>

- Discovery Phase
- Solution Design Phase
- Development Phase
- UAT
- Deployment Phase
- Execute Bots
</aside>

### Discovery Phase

- Process Architect communicate with client and fix the requirement of the client.
- Client requirements are analysed and then it will be decided that the process can be automated or not.
- If the process can be automated, then complexity is measured and benefits provided by the automation.

### Solution Design Phase

- **Process Definition Document**
    
    <aside>
    
    - Contains information about each process step by step
    - Decide budget, number of people working and the time spent on task
    </aside>
    
- **Create Object Model Flowchart**

- **Choose The Best Tool According To Your Need**

### Development Phase

<aside>

- Develop Automation Script for Use-Case
</aside>

### UAT

<aside>

- Testing is done by the process owner in pre-production environment
</aside>

### Deployment Phase

<aside>

- The bot is deployed into the production environment
</aside>

### Execute Bots

<aside>

- Execute the bot to automate the task and see the output
